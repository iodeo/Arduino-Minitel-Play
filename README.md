# Minitel-Play
Videotex games for Arduino

## Description
The games have been developped within MiniPlay project with the objective to build game cartridge as if Minitel was a video game console.

The programs are compatible with Arduinos that are build around atmega328p or atmega32u4, such as Uno, Nano, Pro Mini, Leonardo, Pro Micro, etc.
One can use them to play with a Minitel through the DIN port with few additional components.

TBD : provide generic wiring for arduinos

Alternately, dedicated hardware is available in two versions:
* MiniPlay cartridge: simple and low cost, intended to be preloaded with one game at assembly
* MiniDev cartridge: with usb interface for easy programming in order to change the game or create new ones !

## Compatibility
In terms of serial protocol, the programs are written for compatibility with early Minitel versions.

Hardware such as MiniPlay cartridge needs to be powered from minitel DIN port.
MiniDev cartridge can be powered via usb port alternately.
See table below for information on power source versus minitel types.
